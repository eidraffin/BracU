"""
Explanation:

The complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2). 
The quadratic complexity is caused by the two nested for loops, which iterate regardless of the input data pattern. 
As a result, the complexity of bubble sort is the same whether the situation is best, worst, or average.
The best-case scenario for bubble sort occurs when the array is already sorted in the required order. 
To handle this case, I took a flag variable which is initially False. 
Whenever a swap occurs it becomes True. 
If no swapping occurs in the first run, the array is already sorted and we can break the loop. 
Henceforth, the best-case bubble sort running time would be linear Î¸(n).
